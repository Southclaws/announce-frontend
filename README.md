A SA:MP server listing service that does not rely on the official masterlist where anyone can post server or search for servers.

## Screenshots

Simple, minimal design. Anyone can add a server to the list:

This also allows extra information to be associated with a server, such as a banner:

(note that this is just a mockup with a random server and a random image that are completely unrelated!)
